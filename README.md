# Pok√©mon Crystalis

This is a romhack of Pok&eacute;mon Crystal, made off [pret/pokemon-crystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), by surskitty et al. No monetary gain shall be had from this.

The underlying philosophy of this romhack is to leave it playably a main series Pok&eacute;mon game, simplistic difficulty and all.  Encounters are adjusted so that all Pok&eacute;mon will be available in multiple areas, with as few unfeasibly low appearance rates as possible.  As such, there is no intention of releasing a separate document detailing full appearance lists.

## Major Changes
- Pok&eacute;mon locations and level-up movesets; all Pok&eacute;mon are available eventually and most should be at least usable.
- Ghost is now a Special type and Dark is Physical.
- Poison is super-effective against Bug, just as it was in gen I.
- Base stat adjustments, mostly of single-stage pokemon.
- Trade evolutions can be obtained by either using the item required or by levelling up: 28 for alakazam, 36 for machamp, and 33 for golem and gengar.
- Absorb is now base power 40, Mega Drain 60, and Giga Drain and Leech Life are 80.
- The Fairy type, complete with the moves Fairy Wind and Moonblast.
- Growth and Kinesis now affect stats by two levels.
- The moves Captivate and Fake Tears have been added.
- Egg moves have been updated!  All PCNY event moves should be obtainable, as are egg moves added in later games.
- Psywave has been removed and replaced with Silver Wind.
