# Pokémon Crystalis

This is a romhack of Pok&eacute;mon Crystal, made off [pret/pokemon-crystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), by surskitty et al. No monetary gain shall be had from this.

The underlying philosophy of this romhack is to leave it playably a main series Pok&eacute;mon game, simplistic difficulty and all.  Encounters are adjusted so that all Pok&eacute;mon will be available in multiple areas, with as few unfeasibly low appearance rates as possible.  As such, there is no intention of releasing a separate document detailing full appearance lists.

## Changelog
- Fairy type added
- All 1/8 female pok&eacute;mon changed to 1/4 female.
- Repel prompts you to use another one.
- Hold items added to many wild pok&eacute;mon.
- Detect replaced with Moonblast
- Psywave replaced with Silver Wind
