# Pok√©mon Chrystalis [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

This is a romhack of Pok&eacute;mon Crystal, made off pret/pokemon-crystal, by surskitty et al.

The underlying philosophy of this romhack is to leave it playably a main series Pok&eacute;mon game, simplistic difficulty and all.  Encounters are adjusted so that all Pok&eacute;mon will be available in multiple areas, with as few unfeasibly low appearance rates as possible.  As such, there is no intention of releasing a document detailing full appearance lists.

## Major Changes

- Ghost is now a Special type and Dark is Physical.
- Poison is super-effective against Bug, just as it was in gen I.
- Many underpowered pokemon have had their base stats adjusted!
